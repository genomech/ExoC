# ExoC
Effective molecular diagnosis of congenital diseases hinges on comprehensive genomic analysis, traditionally reliant on various methodologies specific to each variant typeâ€”whole exome or genome sequencing for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), array CGH for copy-number variants (CNVs), and microscopy for structural variants (SVs). We introduce a novel, integrative approach combining exome sequencing with chromosome conformation capture, termed Exo-C. This method enables the concurrent identification of SNVs in clinically relevant genes and SVs across the genome and allows analysis of heterozygous and mosaic carriers. 
Here we developed several pipelines for searching chromosomal rearrangements as inversions and translocations in Exo-C data. You can find detailed instructions for these tools in corresponding folders.
